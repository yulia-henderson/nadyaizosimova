    <h3>artist,  based in Transnistria, Moldova</h3>
    <p>“The largest part of my artistic body of work involves oil on canvas paintings
    in which I am trying to free myself as an artist, to get rid of academic art stereotypes,
    to let myself create freely, and to express what I am feeling. I like to improvise in my
    work by using intuition and emotional sensitivity while making color and compositional
    choices. I also like to combine different materials and techniques such as watercolor,
    gouache, ceramics, collage, and digital painting. I am interested in movement research
    in performance art and in contact improvisation and their connection between emotional
    states and expressing these in visual art pieces. I found movement research very inspiring
    for visual artworks because I have found a really deep connection between my body, my
    emotional states, and my need for artistic expression. Right now my main inspiration comes
    from exploring my emotional landscape and the space around my emotional body”.</p>
