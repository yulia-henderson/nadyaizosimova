    <h1>Nadya Izosimova</h1>
    <h3>artist,  based in Transnistria, Moldova</h3>
    <p>“The big part of my artistic work takes Oil on canvas painting in which I’m  trying to free myself as an artist. To get rid of academical art stereotypes,  to let myself create freely & to express myself as I feel . I like to improvise in my work, by using intuition & emotional sensitivity in making color & compositional choices.
    Also prefer to use and combine  different materials and  techniques  such as  watercolor, gouache, ceramics, collage & digital painting.
    Interested in movement research in performance & contact improvisation & its connection between emotional state & expressing them in visual art pieces. I found movement research very inspiring for the  visual art work, because found really deep connection between body, emotional state & my artistic expression need.
    Now my main inspiration comes from the exploring  of  my emotional field & space around through my emotional body”.</p>
